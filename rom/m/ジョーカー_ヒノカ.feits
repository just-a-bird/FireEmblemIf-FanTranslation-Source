I'm gonna resume\nmy practice again real soon...$k\n$Wsジョーカー|$Wa$E思案,|Despite being the Princess of Hoshido...$k$pYou're always the first one to advance\ntowards the battlefield among everyone...$k$p$E怒,|I have never known anyone\nas gallant as Princess Hinoka.$k\n$Wsヒノカ|$Wa$E笑,|Hm. Gallant, huh. Even so, I did receive\ntrainings fit for a princess when I was a kid,$k$pyou know? Something like how\na princess should talk, and$k$petiquettes and decorum\nduring social meetings...$k$p$E苦,汗|Well, these kind of things have\ncompletely left my body now, though...$k\n$Wsジョーカー|$Wa$E笑,|Hahaha. Indeed, looking at how\nyou are now... It's a bit unimaginable.$k\n$Wsヒノカ|$Wa$E笑,|I have forgotten my life's course as a\nprincess and learnt the way of the blade.$k$pI believe now that it was\nthe right thing to do.$k$p$Eキメ,|Because I...I will continue to\nfight from now on as well.$k\n$Wsジョーカー|$Wa$E怒,|…………$k
MID_支援_ジョーカー_ヒノカ_Ｂ: $t1$Wmジョーカー|3$Wmヒノカ|7$w0|$Wsジョーカー|$WaPrincess Hinoka.$k\n$Wsヒノカ|$WaOh, Joker. What's the matter?$k\n$Wsジョーカー|$Wa$E思案,|This may sound forward, but I have one\nproposal that I wish for you to accept.$k\n$Wsヒノカ|$Wa$E笑,|What is it? You can say it.$k\n$Wsジョーカー|$Wa$E怒,|How about taking in a lesson on\nprincess etiquette once again?$k\n$Wsヒノカ|$Wa$E苦,汗|Etiquette? What sort of advantage would\nthat kind of thing give during these times?$k$pI don't think that it'd be something\nthat one should do during war...$k\n$Wsジョーカー|$Wa$E笑,|Please, don't think about it too deeply and\njust consider it as another way to take a$k$pbreather. If you do it during your free\ntime only, it won't hinder your training.$k$p$E思案,|Naturally, I will be the one to help you.$k\n$Wsヒノカ|$Wa$E笑,|So, you'll be coaching me. Do you really\nwant me to be 'princess-like' so badly?$k$pWell, it might have looked bad for a First\nPrincess to be a 'Battle Princess', I guess.$k$pIf you insist, then I will keep you company.$k$p$Eキメ,|Come on, let's start at once.$k\n$Wsジョーカー|$WaYes. I understand.$k\n$Wc$Sbv40|1000|$Fo1000|$Sbv100|1000|$Fi1000|$Wsジョーカー|$Wa$E笑,|As one would have expected from Princess\nHinoka. You already conduct yourself like a$k$ptrue member of the royal family\nafter just a little bit of guidance.$k\n$Wsヒノカ|$Wa$E笑,|It's all thanks to the training\nI did during my childhood.$k$pI had thought that I had lost it already...\nBut, it appears it hadn't completely left me.$k$pThis is good enough, I guess?$k\n$Wsジョーカー|$WaYes. With this,\nI feel at ease.$k\n$Wsヒノカ|$WaHm. Well then, it's time to get back\ninto the 'Battle Princess' mode again.$k$p$Eキメ,|Now, let's start the training!$k

A war is not something\nthat only happens on a battlefield.$k\n$Wsヒノカ|$Wa$E怒,|…………$k$p$E笑,|...Hmm. I see.$k$p$Eキメ,|So, that's the reason.$k$pDomestic affairs and foreign diplomacy\nare also another form of war, indeed.$k\n$Wsジョーカー|$Wa$E笑,|Yes. A war where one doesn't confront\neach other with blades does exist as well.$k$pThat's what I think.$k\n$Wsヒノカ|$Wa$E通常,|In other words, you have given\nme a new weapon to fight with.$k$pA princess's etiquette and demeanor have\nalso become new blades to protect myself.$k$p$Eキメ,|That's what you mean.$k\n$Wsジョーカー|$Wa$E通常,|Yes.$k\n$Wsヒノカ|$Wa$E笑,|I give you my thanks, Joker.\nI will keep your advice in my heart forever.$k\n$Wsジョーカー|$Wa$E笑,|Thank you very much, Princess Hinoka.$k
