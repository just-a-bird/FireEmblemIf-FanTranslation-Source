That wary silence...$k\n$Wsアクア|$Wa$E苦,汗|My apologies...

MID_支援_アクア_ゼロ_Ｂ: $t1$Wmアクア|7$Wmゼロ|3$E苦,汗|$w0|$Wsゼロ|$WaLady Aqua. I apologize for earlier.\nI should have spoken more clearly.$k\n$Wsアクア|$Wa…………$k\n$Wsゼロ|$Wa$E笑,|To put it plainly,\nI want to befriend you.$k\n$Wsアクア|$Wa$E怒,|Befriend? Me?$k\n$Wsゼロ|$Wa$Eキメ,|Yes.

Let me explain.$k$p$E通常,|I believe that people who like using curious\nremarks on others fall into two categories.$k$p$E怒,|One category consists of those who see\npeople that do not know hardships.$k\n$Wsアクア|$Wa$E怒,|Why?$k\n$Wsゼロ|$WaWhen I was very young,\nI was abandoned by my parents.$k$p$Eにやり,|Since then, I had lived my life in the ghetto.\nPerhaps because of that experience...$k$pWhenever I see someone hasn't struggled,\nI end up wanting to see agony on their face.$k\n$Wsアクア|$Wa$E苦,汗|That upbringing...is it true?$k\n$Wsゼロ|$Wa$E怒,|Yes, it's true.$k$pUntil Lord Leon found me,\nI followed a helpless path.$k\n$Wsアクア|$WaI had no idea...$k\n$Wsゼロ|$Wa$E通常,|And, the second category. Perhaps\nbecause of that sort of upbringing...$k$pThere are people who are bad at\nentering the minds of other people.$k$p$Eにやり,|For those kinds of people, they use such\nwording to keep their distance from others.$k\n$Wsアクア|$Wa$E通常,|…………$k\n$Wsゼロ|$Wa$E通常,|However, my lady does not\nbelong to either group.$k$pYou've had ups and downs in upbringing,\nand you distance yourself from the others.$k$p$E笑,|That's why I secretly thought\nthat we were rather similar.$k\n$Wsアクア|$Wa$E笑,|When you put it that way,\nwe may actually be similar.$k\n$Wsゼロ|$WaYou understand?$k\n$Wsアクア|$Wa$E苦,汗|...Beyond that, I'm surprised.$k$pYou really can hold a conversation\nwithout using any odd expressions.$k\n$Wsゼロ|$Wa$Eキメ,|Of course. That's how I\nget along in life, after all.$k$pIn any case, I would appreciate\nit if we could keep this between us.$k\n$Wsアクア|$Wa$E笑,|...Okay.\nWell then, let's speak again.$k$pWhat to talk about...until then,\nI'll think it over.$k\n$Wsゼロ|$Wa$E笑,|Understood.\nI'll be looking forward to it.$k
