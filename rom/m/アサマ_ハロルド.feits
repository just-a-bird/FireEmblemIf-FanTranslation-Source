MID_支援_アサマ_ハロルド_Ｃ: $t1$Wmアサマ|7$Wmハロルド|3$w0|$Wsハロルド|$WaI believe your name is Asama?$k$pWhat do you do to keep yourself useful\nhere?$k\n$Wsアサマ|$WaUseful? Oh, you mean my duties?$k$pI serve under Hoshido's first princess, the\nLady Hinoka.$k\n$Wsハロルド|$WaPrincess Hinoka? Oh, yeah, I know which\nbroad you're talking about.$k$pYou work under her, huh?$k\n$Wsアサマ|$Wa$E笑,|Ahaha. I wouldn't call it "working under her."$k$pIn fact she probably helps me more than I\nhelp her.$k$pShe is very strong, of course.$k\n$Wsハロルド|$Wa$E苦,|What?! You're able to get someone like that\nto help you?$k\n$Wsアサマ|$WaI suppose so. And you?$k\n$Wsハロルド|$Wa$Eキメ,|I am an attendant to Princess Elise!$k\n$Wsアサマ|$Wa$E通常,|Princess Elise's retainer? That must be a\ntiring job.$k$pI hear that she is quite a handful.$k\n$Wsハロルド|$Wa$E苦,|I should smack you for even suggesting\nsuch a thing!$k$p$E通常,|Our cultural differences are as apparent as\nday and night.$k$pBut, I was ordered to try and get along with\nyou all.$k$pEven if you do not see her charm and love-\nliness, I've no intention of punishing you!$k\n$Wsアサマ|$Wa$Eキメ,|Cultural differences and such... is it?$k$pI actually think that Hoshido and Nohr are\nnot that different at all.$k$pPutting all your faith into something like a\n"country" is like building a house on sand.$k$pAt the end of the day, they'll both be\nground to dust, just like everything else.$k\n$Wsハロルド|$Wa$E怒,|What in blue blazes are you babbling about?$k$pAren't you also here to fight for your\ncountry? Even if it's just talk, you'll$k$pbe in trouble if you get caught talking about\nNohr being ground to dust and all that.$k\n$Wsアサマ|$Wa$E通常,|Is that so? I only thought I was telling the\ntruth.$k\n$Wsハロルド|$Wa$E苦,|Aaaargh! Do you not have one\npatriotic bone in you!?$k\n$Wsアサマ|$Wa$E笑,|Hoho, do you normally get this fired\nup about some idle small talk?$k$pYou are a peculiar fellow indeed.\nThis is why Nohrians are so interesting.$k$pI think I like you. Well then, I'll see you\naround if we live long enough.$k\n$Wsアサマ|$Wd$w0|$Wsハロルド|$Wa$E怒,|H-hold it! I haven't finished speaking to you!\nCome baaaaaaaー!!!$k$p*thump*$k$p$E怒,汗|ARGH!$k$pWho the hell put this pit trap here and told\nnot a soul?!?!$k$pHelp! HEEEEEEEELPーーー!!!$k
MID_支援_アサマ_ハロルド_Ｂ: $t1$Wmアサマ|7$Wmハロルド|3$w0|$Wsハロルド|$WaWell, we seem to be meeting each other\nquite often on the battlefield.$k\n$Wsアサマ|$WaThat does seem to be true. I do wonder\nwhy.$k\n$Wsアサマ|$WaOh, yes yes.$k$pThis is something I've overheard...$k$pBut apparently, you are knownas Nohr's\nAlly of Justice?$k\n$Wsハロルド|$Wa$Eキメ,|Naturally!$k$pHe who protects the weak and crushes the\nwicked, Harold, Hero of Justice!$k\n$Wsアサマ|$WaOh! And such a splendid introduction! But\nit seems like something was missing...$k$p$Eキメ,|Was it not "He who crushes the weak with\nhis clumsiness and misfortune"...?$k\n$Wsハロルド|$Wa$E苦,|Gah?! What manner of villain has\nperpetuated such scandalous rumors?$k\n$Wsアサマ|$Wa$E笑,|Ah. I had the pleasure of speaking with\nsome of your Nohrian gentlemen comrades.$k\n$Wsハロルド|$WaArgh! What I would not give to get rid of\nbearing that shame!$k$pIf only things like "bad luck" and "fate"\ncould be vanquished in battle!$k\n$Wsアサマ|$Wa$Eキメ,|That appears to be impossible.$k$pIn your case, your luck seems to be some\nsort of divine punishment.$k\n$Wsハロルド|$WaD-divine punishment?$k\n$Wsアサマ|$WaYes.$k$pIf I were to say it simply, it's as if God has\ntaken a fancy in toying with your existence.$k\n$Wsハロルド|$Wa$E怒,|W-what the!?$k\n$Wsアサマ|$WaIt may be why bizarre phenomena follow you\naround like a cloud of mosquitoes.$k\n$Wsハロルド|$WaT-that cannot possibly be the case!$k$pI have lived piously all my life! How can this\nbe a form of punishment?$k\n$Wsアサマ|$Wa$E笑,|Ahaha.$k$pI understand that feeling. But, do you have\nan alternate explanation?$k\n$Wsハロルド|$Wa$E苦,|Well...There might be a 5% chance of it\nbeing true...$k\n$Wsアサマ|$WaDon't look so depressed.$k$pI mean, regardless of whether or not we\nreceive divine punishment, we all die, right?$k$pIt's only a question of how fast or how slow.\nBut, let's think positive.$k$p$Eキメ,|God must be keeping an eye on you, but I\nthink it may be because you are fascinating.$k$pPerhaps it means that God is jealous of\nyou?$k\n$Wsハロルド|$Wa$E通常,|God is jealous... of me?$k\n$Wsアサマ|$WaOn second thought, that could get us\nboth struck by lightning, so forget it.$k$pWell, what I'm really trying to say is... don't\nworry, be happy.$k\n$Wsハロルド|$WaUgh, you sure are a mysterious one. Does\neveryone in Hoshido think like you do?$k\n$Wsアサマ|$Wa$E笑,|Ahaha, no.$k$pIf that were the case, it probably *would*\nbe ground to dust by now...$k\n$Wsハロルド|$Wa$E苦,|............$k$p...What in the world does Princess Hinoka\nsee in that guy?$k
MID_支援_アサマ_ハロルド_Ａ: $t1$Wmアサマ|7$Wmハロルド|3$w0|$Wsハロルド|$WaI heard just how you came to\nserve Princess Hinoka.$k\n$Wsアサマ|$WaYou did, did you?$k\n$Wsハロルド|$WaYou were formerly the second son of\na priest at a small shrine.$k$pApparently, you were mischievous, foul-\nmouthed and completely out of control...$k$pYou were ordered to climb up various\nsacred mountains, and all of a sudden,$k$pwhile carrying out your penance, suddenly\nyou became a calm and priest-like person.$k\n$Wsアサマ|$Wa$E笑,|Ahaha.$k$pIt's always awkward listening to an objective\naccount of one's own history.$k\n$Wsハロルド|$WaOne day, while meditating on a mountain...$k$pYou'd found a pegasus warrior\nthat had crashed.$k$pPrincess Hinoka.$k\n$Wsアサマ|$Wa$E通常,|Oh, the memories are coming back now.$k$pBecause she had sustained\nsuch bad injuries.$k$pI tried to give her the\nbest medical aid I could.$k$pAfter that, the Princess wanted\nto thank me somehow...$k\n$Wsハロルド|$WaBut after getting her to safety, you just\nsaid you didn't want anything and then left.$k\n$Wsアサマ|$WaYes.$k$pWell, I didn't really have any\nneed for any reward...$k\n$Wsハロルド|$WaWell, you must have left a deep\nenough impression on her.$k$pSo much so that she tried everything\nshe could to track you down.$k$pShe apparently tried to directly appoint you\nto the royal knights as a personal retainer.$k\n$Wsアサマ|$Wa$E笑,|Ahaha. It's amazing that you managed\nto get all that information.$k$pBut I should add that she also appointed\nLady Setsuna to the royal knighthood.$k$pI'm not really that special in that regard...$k\n$Wsハロルド|$Wa$Eキメ,|...I see.\nStill you are something else.$k$pI apologize for being rude earlier.$k\n$Wsアサマ|$Wa$E通常,|It's nothing.\nNothing you ever said bothered me.$k$pI try not to waste time on\nthings like that.$k\n$Wsハロルド|$Wa$E通常,|............$k$pI have a strange feeling\nwhen talking to you.$k$pAs if there's something missing\nthat's there when I'm here.$k\n$Wsアサマ|$WaPlease, I'm not that special.$k$p...Although, I just hope it isn't\na bad feeling.$k\n$Wsハロルド|$Wa$Eキメ,|Well, I have to admit it.$k$pTalking with you has certainly\nchanged my view on some things.$k\n$Wsアサマ|$Wa$Eキメ,|I'm glad. Let us work together\ntoward a brighter future, Harold.$k
