MID_支援_オーディン_レオン_Ａ: $t1$Wmオーディン|7$Wmレオン|3$w0|$Wsレオン|$WaOdin.$k\n$Wsオーディン|$Wa$E笑,|Oh! Lord Leon!\nI was waiting!$k$p$Eキメ,|Now, you should appoint me,\ncomposed prince...

Because I don't want to make\na retainer out of anyone but soldiers$k$pI can trust, I had hoped this kind of\nobjectionable order would cause you$k$pto leave.$k$p$E苦,汗|After all, it's impossible\nunder normal circumstances.$k$pI didn't even know that there was an\nobsidian holding the darkness of Nohr...$k\n$Wsオーディン|$Wa$E笑,|Well, I do know darkness...$k\n$Wsレオン|$Wa$E怒,汗|And the forest canopy's\nghost is terrifying...$k\n$Wsオーディン|$Wa$Eキメ,|Better than Risen...$k\n$Wsレオン|$Wa$E通常,|Risen?$k\n$Wsオーディン|$Wa$E通常,|Just the animals back home.$k\n$Wsレオン|$Wa$E苦,|Ahh, really...$k$p$E怒,汗|But, back to the point; usually it's\nimpossible for regular soldiers.$k\n$Wsオーディン|$Wa$E怒,汗|I see... Basically, because\nyou didn't want to take me,$k$pyou gave me those challenges.$k\n$Wsレオン|$Wa$E通常,|Yes. But, I've recognized\nyou as a retainer now.$k$pBut...it's precisely because of that,\nthat I can't afford to give you those$k$pdangerous missions.$k$p$E笑,|So, that's why I'm not giving\nyou missions from before. Got it?$k\n$Wsオーディン|$Wa$E通常,|...Yeah. If that's how it is...$k\n$Wsレオン|$Wa$Eキメ,|Listen, it'll be a problem if you disappear.$k$pWhen this world becomes peaceful, I need\nboth you and Zero serving by my side.$k\n$Wsオーディン|$Wa$E苦,汗|After it becomes peaceful...$k$p…………$k\n$Wsレオン|$Wa$E通常,|...What's wrong?$k\n$Wsオーディン|$Wa$E怒,|Nothing. So... So then.$k$pWhen this world becomes\npeaceful, if I'm gone...$k$pWould you take on a new retainer?$k\n$Wsレオン|$Wa$E怒,|...I would. If you're gone,\nit can't be helped.$k\n$Wsオーディン|$Wa$E苦,汗|...I'm glad, then.$k\n$Wsレオン|$Wa$E通常,|But...because someone like you\nprobably wouldn't be around,$k$pperhaps things will\nfeel empty without you.$k\n$Wsオーディン|$Wa$E通常,汗|...Huh!?$k\n$Wsレオン|$Wa$Eキメ,|After all...this whole time, you've\nbeen my retainer, haven't you?$k$pI don't know if it's a different world\nor distant timeline, but, wherever you$k$pare...you can still call\nyourself my retainer, right?$k\n$Wsオーディン|$Wa$E怒,汗|L-Lord Leon... Do you\nknow about my situation...?$k\n$Wsレオン|$Wa$E通常,|No, I don't know anything.$k$pI don't know what kind of\nsetting this is...or if it's a story.$k$p$E笑,|And because of that,\nI could think, 'it's okay, isn't it?'$k$pSo, I wonder what to\nmake your next order.$k$p"No matter what world, always\ncontinue to be my retainer."$k$p...How's that?$k\n$Wsオーディン|$Wa…………$k$p$Eキメ,|Understood...Lord Leon.\nI'll...follow those orders no matter what.$k$pAbsolutely...!!$k\n$Wsレオン|$Wa$Eキメ,|Yeah...
