Queen Mikoto...\nShe said it wasn't true.$k$pShe said there'd be a future where the\ntwo kingdoms would get along someday.$k$pThat's what she had told me...$k$p$E笑,|When she handed me this kimono...$k$pShe said that if I ever met the\nchild who was born that time...$k$pThat I should give it to her.$k$pI remembered her request, so I\ncame here and thought I would give$k$pthat to you now.$k\n$Wsエリーゼ|$Wa…………$k$p$E笑,|Was Queen Mikoto...a nice person?$k\n$Wsアクア|$Wa$E笑2,|Yes, absolutely so. She was a\nwoman I very much looked up to...$k\n$Wsエリーゼ|$Wa$E通常,|So I see...
