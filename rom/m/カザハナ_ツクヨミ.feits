So, it's fine.$k$pWell... I probably was a bit reckless about\nit. So, I've reflected on what I did there.$k\n$Wsツクヨミ|$Wa$E通常,|Hmph. Well if you didn't get the wrong idea,\nthen I'll hold no more concern about it.$k\n$Wsカザハナ|$Wa$E通常,|Thank you, Tsukuyomi!$k\n$Wsツクヨミ|$WaBesides, if you weren't around, then that\npouch would be out in the cold still.$k\n$Wsカザハナ|$Wa$E通常,汗|Huh?$k\n$Wsツクヨミ|$Wa$E通常,汗|The truth is...\nAnother one was sent to me.$k\n$Wsカザハナ|$WaAnother pouch?$k\n$Wsツクヨミ|$Wa$E苦,|Yes.

It's really pretty!$k\n$Wsツクヨミ|$Wa$E怒,|And I still don't get why.$k\n$Wsカザハナ|$Wa$E通常,|That's right, Tsukuyomi! There's a cherry\nblossom pattern inside the pouch this time?$k\n$Wsツクヨミ|$Wa$E通常,|Cherry blossom?\nIt didn't have one.$k$pBut if they're going to send me\nanother one, the pattern'll probably be in the inside too.$k\n$Wsカザハナ|$Wa$E笑,|If it's a cherry blossom pattern, then it's\ngoing to be mine for sure! Promise me!$k\n$Wsツクヨミ|$WaYou didn't have to draw attention to it.\nI was going to do that? But...$k$pWhy are you fussing over\ncherry blossom patterns?$k\n$Wsカザハナ|$Wa$Eキメ,|Because it has the same\nmeaning as Sakura's name?$k$pIt didn't have anything of\nthe sort with the last one...$k$pSo if I see one in due time,\nthen I'll give it to Sakura!$k\n$Wsツクヨミ|$Wa$E通常,汗|I get it...\nA retainer's loyalty?$k\n$Wsカザハナ|$Wa$E通常,|Maybe...$k$pBut just in case, then I'll go looking\nfor a Tsubaki flower pattern too?$k$pHmm...\nBut, Tsubaki is a guy.$k$pIt would be complicated to give him\nsomething with a floral pattern.$k$pNever mind the Tsubaki flower.\nJust cherry pattern please!$k\n$Wsツクヨミ|$Wa$E笑,|I understand.\nI'll think about your request, Kazahana.$k\n$Wsカザハナ|$Wa$E笑,|Thanks!$k
