I'm sewing\nsomething called a patchwork.$k\n$Wsヒノカ|$WaHm. Sewing, huh...$k$p$E怒,|But this is...! You're joining all\nthese scraps of cloth together?$k$pThe colors look so vivid.$k\n$Wsカミラ|$Wa$E笑,|Teehee, the cloth pattern\nchanges your impression of it.$k$pThat's what makes patchwork so fun.$k\n$Wsヒノカ|$Wa$E笑,|You're quite skilled with\nyour hands, Princess Camilla.$k$pI can't believe you could\nsew something like this...$k\n$Wsカミラ|$WaOh my! It's only natural for a lady to be\nknowledgeable about something like this.$k$pPerhaps it's not your strong\nsuit, Princess Hinoka?$k\n$Wsヒノカ|$Wa$E怒,|*gulp* ...To be honest, that type of\nminute work doesn't really appeal to me.$k\n$Wsカミラ|$Wa$E怒,|I see... That's a shame.$k\n$Wsヒノカ|$Wa$E苦,|What? Why?$k\n$Wsカミラ|$Wa$E苦,|Well, if you can't sew...\nthen that means you won't$k$pbe able to mend\nclothes for $Nu.$k\n$Wsヒノカ|$Wa$E怒,|!$k\n$Wsカミラ|$Wa$Eキメ,|Earlier, I mended $Nu's cloak.\nThey were very happy about it.$k\n$Wsヒノカ|$Wa$E苦,|What!?$k\n$Wsカミラ|$Wa$E笑,|As $Nu's older sister, I want to make\nthem the most beautiful of clothes...$k$p$E怒,|When I think of it like that,\nthe situation you find yourself$k$pin seems rather unsatisfactory.$k\n$Wsヒノカ|$Wa$E怒,|Ugh...! It's a sound argument...\nI can't talk back to her...!$k$pI may be $Nu's older sister,\nbut there's nothing I can do$k$pfor $Nu...!$k\n$Wsカミラ|$Wa…………$k$p$E通常,|Princess Hinoka. Would you like\nfor me to teach you how to sew?$k\n$Wsヒノカ|$Wa$E通常,|Wait, are you serious!?$k\n$Wsカミラ|$Wa$E笑,|Yes. We may be from different\ncountries, but we're fellow princesses.$k$pWe should try to get along.$k\n$Wsヒノカ|$Wa$E怒,|I see...\nIn that case, please do.$k\n$Wsカミラ|$Wa$Eキメ,|Teehee, very well.\nLeave it to me.$k
MID_支援_カミラ_ヒノカ_Ｂ: $a$t1$Wmカミラ|7$Wmヒノカ|3$Wsカミラ|$Wa$E笑,|$w0|Well then, Princess Hinoka.\nLet's practice how to sew!$k\n$Wsヒノカ|$WaAlright. I'll try my hardest to\ncatch up to you, Princess Camilla.$k\n$Wsカミラ|$WaSince you're a beginner, let's\nstart with something simple.$k$pCould you sew together these black\npieces of cloth with the white thread?$k\n$Wsヒノカ|$WaYeah. Sewing something like that\nshould be easy. Well then, I'll start...$k$p$E怒,|Ouch! I pricked my\nfinger with the needle!$k\n$Wsカミラ|$Wa$E怒,|Oh my. Are you all right?$k\n$Wsヒノカ|$Wa$E通常,|Yeah, a tiny needle like this\ndoesn't pose a problem for―$k$p$E苦,|Ow! I pricked myself again!$k\n$Wsカミラ|$Wa$E通常,|When affixing cloth, you'll be using\nplenty of needles, so you have to be$k$pcareful.$k\n$Wsヒノカ|$Wa$E怒,|Yeah, I was being careless...but I\nwon't make the same mistake now!$k$pNext up, um... You join these pieces of\ncloth together...and stitch...and stitch...$k\n$Wsカミラ|$Wa$E苦,|…………$k$pPrincess Hinoka.$k$pYou've made a mark at the\nspot you've been sewing at...$k$pBut you do realize you're gradually\ngoing off the path, don't you?$k\n$Wsヒノカ|$Wa$E苦,|What!? Y-you're right...\nWhen did that happen...?$k\n$Wsカミラ|$Wa$E苦,汗|And what's more, the spaces\nbetween your stitches are uneven...$k$pSo the cloth doesn't look\nvery pleasing to the eye.$k\n$Wsヒノカ|$Wa$E苦,汗|Ahh... Sewing really is hard, huh.\nI didn't think it would be this difficult$k$pfor me...$k\n$Wsカミラ|$Wa$E怒,汗|Hmm... Maybe I should say your\nclumsiness is worse than expected?$k$pThis type of thing requires a lot of effort.$k\n$Wsヒノカ|$Wa$E怒,汗|I-I'm sorry...$k\n$Wsカミラ|$Wa$E笑,|It's fine. I was the one who said we\nshould learn to get along, after all.$k\n$Wsヒノカ|$Wa$E通常,|Get along...?$k\n$Wsカミラ|$Wa$E通常,|Yes. When I first learned about you...$k$pAbout $Nu's real older\nsister, I must admit I was jealous.$k$p$E笑,|But...$k$pWhen I heard that $Nu's capture\nmade her wish to become stronger...$k$pMy viewpoint changed somewhat.$k$p$Eキメ,|That she wanted to be strong for\ntheir sake, that left a deep impression$k$pon me.$k\n$Wsヒノカ|$Wa$E怒,|Princess Camilla...$k\n$Wsカミラ|$WaWho wouldn't want to befriend\na lovely older sister like that?$k$pSo please, don't mind what happened\nthis time. I'm relying on you.$k\n$Wsヒノカ|$Wa$E笑,|I see... Very well. If that's so,\nthen I accept your offer.$k$pThank you, Princess Camilla. I hope we'll\nbe able to get along from here on out.$k\n$Wsカミラ|$Wa$E笑,|Teehee, of course.\nThen let's keep trying, shall we?$k\n$Wsヒノカ|$Wa$Eキメ,|Yeah!$k

Thanks to what you taught\nme, I was able to sew straight.$k$pAlthough, I can only seem to\nsew in a straight line now...$k$pSo I suppose my clumsiness\nremains unchanged...$k\n$Wsカミラ|$Wa$Eキメ,|Not at all... The way you've joined\nthe seams together is so beautiful.$k$pCongratulations, Princess Hinoka.$k\n$Wsヒノカ|$Wa$E笑,|Hehe, thank you,\nPrincess Camilla.$k\n$Wsカミラ|$Wa$E笑,|It's all right.$k$pYou were able to put all of this\neffort into it, because you did it$k$pfor $Nu's sake.$k\n$Wsヒノカ|$Wa$E怒,|...You may say that, Princess Camilla,\nbut I don't think that's all there is to it.$k\n$Wsカミラ|$Wa$E怒,|Huh?$k\n$Wsヒノカ|$Wa$E通常,|As older sisters, we both share\nthe same kind of sibling love$k$ptowards $Nu.$k$pBut, even though we come\nfrom two different countries...$k$pRight now, we're partners\nwho fight together.$k$p$E笑,|More than anything else...$k$pI think what spurred me to do this was\nliving up to the expectations of my partner.$k\n$Wsカミラ|$Wa$E笑,|...I'm happy you think so highly of me.\nI must express my gratitude.$k$pThank you, Princess Hinoka.$k\n$Wsヒノカ|$Wa$E怒,照|N-no...
