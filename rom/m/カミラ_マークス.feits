MID_支援_カミラ_マークス_Ｃ: $a$t1$Wmカミラ|7$Wmマークス|3$w0|$Wsマークス|$Wa...Camilla. You were here.$k\n$Wsカミラ|$Wa$E笑,|Oh my, Marx.$k\n$Wsマークス|$Wa$E怒,|It's war council after this.\nI was searching for you.$k\n$Wsカミラ|$Wa$Eキメ,|Oh, that's right. I was\njust talking to $Nu.$k\n$Wsマークス|$Wa$E通常,|With $Nu? About what?$k\n$Wsカミラ|$Wa$E苦,|...I'll tell you Marx but, it was about\nsomething that was troubling them.$k\n$Wsマークス|$Wa$E怒,|About something troubling\nthem...was it?$k\n$Wsカミラ|$Wa$Eキメ,|Yes. But don't worry,\nit's been sorted out now.$k$p$E苦,|Ah... nevertheless,\ntoday has been hectic.$k$pBefore $Nu, it was Leon.\nAnd before Leon, Elise...$k$p$E笑,|Everyone came looking for advice...\nTo get things sorted out.$k\n$Wsマークス|$Wa$E苦,|Is that so... They didn't\nsay anything to me...$k\n$Wsカミラ|$Wa$Eキメ,|It's surely just a difference in role.\nI appear as a helpful older sister.$k$p$E通常,|Marx seems like he focuses\nmore on war more so than family...$k\n$Wsマークス|$Wa$E怒,|…………$k$pWell, it's not really\nlike that, is it...?$k\n$Wsカミラ|$Wa$E怒,|...Hm?$k\n$Wsマークス|$Wa$E通常,|Never mind. In any case,\nnow is war council. Let's go.$k\n$Wsカミラ|$Wa$E怒,汗|Eh, y-yes...$k
MID_支援_カミラ_マークス_Ｂ: $a$t1$Wmカミラ|7$Wmマークス|3$w0|$Wsマークス|$WaCamilla. I want to talk to you\nabout something for a bit.$k\n$Wsカミラ|$WaWhat is it, I wonder?$k\n$Wsマークス|$Wa$E怒,|About what you said. That I put\nmore importance on war than family.$k$pI'll tell you, but I'm not\nreally a person like that.$k\n$Wsカミラ|$Wa$E笑,|Oh my, what's wrong?$k$pIs it about $Nu and the others\nturning to me for advice and not you?$k\n$Wsマークス|$Wa$E苦,|No, it's not that. It's just...$k$p$E怒,|I focus equally on work and family.$k\n$Wsカミラ|$Wa$E怒,|Oh, truly? That's quite surprising...$k$p$E怒,汗|So then Marx. Do you mind if\nI test that theory for a bit?$k\n$Wsマークス|$Wa$E通常,|Test it...?$k\n$Wsカミラ|$Wa$E通常,|To see how much you know\nabout family... I'd like to test you.$k\n$Wsマークス|$Wa$E笑,|That's fine.$k\n$Wsカミラ|$Wa$E怒,|Okay then, first is...\nWhat's my favorite food?$k\n$Wsマークス|$Wa$E怒,|Sweet food. Among other\nthings, fresh fruit.$k\n$Wsカミラ|$Wa$E笑,|Correct. As expected of my big\nbrother. So then the next question is...$k\n$Wsマークス|$Wa$E通常,|Hold on. I haven't\nfinished answering yet.$k\n$Wsカミラ|$Wa$E笑,汗|Huh?$k\n$Wsマークス|$Wa$E怒,|Of course, you enjoy sweet food.\nBut what you really like is meat.$k\n$Wsカミラ|$Wa$E怒,汗|Eh?$k\n$Wsマークス|$Wa$E通常,|Among all meats, you prefer beef.$k$p$E笑,|You prefer it cooked with\nthe outside lightly grilled.$k\n$Wsカミラ|$Wa$E通常,汗|How do you know this much...$k\n$Wsマークス|$WaI know more than just that. I also\nknow you're picky with seasonings.$k
MID_支援_カミラ_マークス_Ａ: $a$t1$Wmカミラ|7$Wmマークス|3$w0|$Wsマークス|$Wa$E笑,|Camilla. That test\nfrom before was fun.$k\n$Wsカミラ|$Wa$Eキメ,|...Yes. I just kept being surprised.$k$p$E笑,|My favorite food, Elise's hobbies, Leon's\nobsessions, $Nu's favorite smell...$k$pYou even got Father's favorite phrase...$k$pEven the questions about the most minute\ndetails you've answered so flawlessly.$k$p$Eキメ,|Yes... you're perfect, but\nI didn't know most of it...$k$pThe fact that you knew all\nof that about our family...$k\n$Wsマークス|$Wa$E通常,|It's good that you understand. I'm\nnot apathetic towards our family.$k$pI just appear indifferent...$k\n$Wsカミラ|$Wa$E笑,|It seems so. I really\ngot a better view...$k$pIf I see an opportunity, I'll try to undo\neveryone's misgivings about you.$k\n$Wsマークス|$Wa$E怒,|No, let's just drop\nthe matter altogether.$k\n$Wsカミラ|$Wa$E通常,|But why?$k$pIf we undo their misgivings, everyone\nwill start talking to you in person more.$k\n$Wsマークス|$Wa$E苦,|Perhaps that seems fun. However,\nI don't think that's the case.$k$pI think for a First Prince like me, I can't\nafford to be in a difficult situation.$k$pI think keeping some sense of distance\nbetween my siblings would be better.$k$p$E通常,|So Camilla, I'll leave everyone's\npersonal and intimate details to you.$k\n$Wsカミラ|$Wa$E苦,|But, that's just... Well, if you've\ndecided to take it upon yourself...$k\n$Wsマークス|$Wa$E笑,|Yes. Well, even if it's just you\nthat understands, that's fine.$k$pDon't worry about anything.$k$pYou said it as well, but...\nIt's just the difference in our roles.$k$p$E怒,|I should keep to being the rigid\nand unapproachable First Prince.$k\n$Wsカミラ|$Wa$E笑,|...If there's anything I can\ndo for you, please tell me.$k$pBecause I always want to be of\nassistance to my big brother.$k\n$Wsマークス|$Wa$E笑,|Thank you. As expected\nof Nohr's First Princess...$k$pWell, this might be sudden, but let's\ncontinue the test from the other day.$k$pIt's unexpectedly become\nan interesting habit...$k\n$Wsカミラ|$Wa$Eキメ,|Haha... Alright. I won't\nlose this time, okay?$k
