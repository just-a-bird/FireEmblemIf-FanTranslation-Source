How so?$k\n$Wsカゲロウ|$Wa$Eキメ,|The only female warrior from the\nFlame tribe, Rinka, and Hoshido's$k$pfemale ninja Kagerou,\nare noteworthy in strength.$k$pYour strength, my technique,\nboth are quite eye-opening.$k$pWhich one of the two is stronger, that's \nwhat people seem to be gossiping about.$k\n$Wsリンカ|$Wa$E笑,| I see.$k$pI dislike it when people talk\nabout me when I'm not there.$k$pHowever, having people discuss the power\nI trained hard for doesn't feel bad.$k\n$Wsカゲロウ|$Wa$E笑,|I agree, I dislike gossiping.\nHowever, this is an exception.$k$pSince it's been recognized by everyone.$k\n$Wsリンカ|$Wa$E通常,|Kagerou.

About the wrestling\nmatch the other day.$k\n$Wsリンカ|$Wa$E怒,|Ahhh, thinking about it makes me mad!\nIn the end, we didn't settle anything,$k$pthe crowd went out of control there!$k\n$Wsカゲロウ|$Wa$E苦,|Goodness, where did everyone\nhear about our duel?$k\n$Wsリンカ|$Wa$E苦,|Those guys probably came\nout of pure curiosity.$k$pThey must have mistaken it for a festival\nor something. Making such a racket.$k\n$Wsカゲロウ|$WaIn the end, we couldn't concentrate\non wrestling, but it can't be helped.$k$p$Eキメ,|Because we're being judged by everyone,\neveryone would want to come and watch.$k\n$Wsリンカ|$Wa$E通常,|I guess so. It got interesting\nin the middle, too.$k$p$E笑,|It's been a while since I had such an\nenjoyable sumo wrestling match. $k\n$Wsカゲロウ|$Wa$E通常,|Did you do this often at home, Rinka?$k\n$Wsリンカ|$Wa$E通常,|Sumo was originally played among men.\nBut I mixed in at times.$k\n$Wsカゲロウ|$Wa$E怒,|I see. So you could only\nenjoy it once in a while.$k\n$Wsリンカ|$Wa$E苦,|No, I defeated all those men effortlessly.\nAnd the number of men began to dwindle.$k$pIn the end, there was no\none left for me to fight.$k\n$Wsカゲロウ|$Wa$E笑,|Hmmm, I see. So there was no\nopponent that could challenge you.$k\n$Wsリンカ|$Wa$E笑,|Yes, that's why I'm glad to have\nmet someone as strong as you.$k\n$Wsカゲロウ|$Wa$Eキメ,|What an honor. Let us continue\nto extend our horizons together.$k\n$Wsリンカ|$Wa$Eキメ,|Let us. I'm counting on you, Kagerou!$k
