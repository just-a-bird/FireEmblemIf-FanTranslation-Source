All I did\nwas point out suggestions for$k$pestablishing an emotional\nbond with your pegasus.$k\n$Wsヒノカ|$Wa$E通常,|In those days, all I had was\na heart that detested Nohr...$k$pIt seemed like the pegasi saw\nthrough those negative feelings.$k$pAt that time, you taught me a\ntechnique to calm my heart...$k\n$Wsツバキ|$Wa$E笑,|Ahaha～. Did I really～?\nWhat...did I say, I wonder...?$k\n$Wsヒノカ|$Wa$E笑,|That's right... Change your awareness so as\nnot to manipulate the pegasus, but to relate$k$pto the pegasus, and also to listen to the\nswaying of every tree and the chirp of every$k$psmall bird.
