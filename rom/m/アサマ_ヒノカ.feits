Th-that's...\nI was going to fix it.$k\n$Wsアサマ|$WaWhat's more, the edges of\nyour clothes are wrinkled.$k$pIt seems you didn't\nfold them properly.$k$pAs a princess, how could you\nwear clothes like that...?$k\n$Wsヒノカ|$Wa$E苦,汗|Grr... Saying that,\nyou're just being too nosy!$k\n$Wsアサマ|$WaAnd the other day, your\nbelongings were scattered$k$pall around the tent where the\nwar council was being held.$k$p$E笑,|Ahaha... Just remembering that makes\nme laugh. That was rather funny.$k\n$Wsヒノカ|$WaThat is... I just accidentally knocked over\nthe bag that was holding my things!$k$pAlways nagging about those\nkinds of small mistakes...$k$pWhen I first met you, I didn't think\nyou would be this kind of person...$k\n$Wsアサマ|$Wa$Eキメ,|Ah...$k$pA long time ago, you fell while\nyou were doing your training.$k$pYou were just lying on the mountainside.\nThat was very ungraceful of you.$k$pDespite myself, I took mercy on\nyou and treated your wounds.$k\n$Wsヒノカ|$Wa$E怒,|Ungraceful...? At that time, you didn't\nexpect anything in return, and you left$k$pwithout introducing yourself.\nSo, I thought you were very wise$k$pand mistook you for a very\nhigh-ranked priest! And yet...$k$pyou were hired as a servant.$k\n$Wsアサマ|$Wa$E怒,|The way you did it was\nreally rude, wasn't it.$k$pYou searched for me and\nforcibly made me your retainer...$k$pReally, I thought you were\nan overbearing tyrant.$k\n$Wsヒノカ|$Wa$E苦,|I didn't do such an aggressive thing!\nAnyway, if I knew your true personality$k$pin advance, I never would\nhave made you my retainer.$k$p"Are you a princess? When I saw you fall\nfrom your pegasus onto the mountain,$k$pI thought you were just a foolish\ngirl hailing from the countryside."$k$pThose were the first words you\nsaid when you became my retainer...$k$pI haven't forgotten!$k\n$Wsアサマ|$Wa$E笑,|Ahaha, is that so? The one who's\nalways nagging is you, Lady Hinoka.$k$pThat's annoying. You're the kind of\nwoman who's fixated on the past, huh...$k\n$Wsヒノカ|$Wa$E通常,|Enough already...\nThis conversation, I've gotten used to it...$k
MID_支援_アサマ_ヒノカ_Ｂ: $t1$Wmヒノカ|7$w0|$Wsヒノカ|$Wa…………$k\n$Wmアサマ|3$w0|$Wsアサマ|$Wa$E笑,|Well, well, you look\ndisheartened, Lady Hinoka.$k\n$Wsヒノカ|$Wa$E苦,|...Asama.\nIt can't be helped...$k$pIn the last skirmish, many\nnew recruits were sacrificed...$k$pThere's something wrong with someone\nwho doesn't feel pain over such a thing.$k\n$Wsアサマ|$WaIs that so?\nI didn't think much of it.$k\n$Wsヒノカ|$WaAh...that's right. But, you don't\nshed either blood or tears...?$k\n$Wsアサマ|$Wa$E通常,|No, no, I'm not the kind of person who's\nlike an ogre or demon or something like$k$pthat. I'm just an ordinary\npriest who serves the gods.$k\n$Wsヒノカ|$Wa$E怒,|Then why are you so calm\nabout something like this...?!$k\n$Wsアサマ|$Wa$Eキメ,|Try to think about it.\nPeople are always dying.$k$pThat is unchangeable. Whether it's quick or\nslow, there's nothing to be done about it.$k$pThat's why you shouldn't worry\nso much about people's deaths.$k\n$Wsヒノカ|$Wa$E通常,|Then, at that time, why did\nyou save me as I was dying?$k\n$Wsアサマ|$Wa...Your face, then. You had a strong will\nto live, your face was fierce with anger.$k$pI was attracted to that.$k\n$Wsヒノカ|$Wa$E通常、汗,|What...?$k\n$Wsアサマ|$Wa$E笑,|I thought you would have\nan interesting life from then.$k$pI grew interested in what\nkind of life you would have.$k\n$Wsヒノカ|$Wa$E苦,|Then, those who died earlier, you\nhave no attachment to their lives?$k\n$Wsアサマ|$Wa$E通常,|Yes, not as much as I have\nto yours... That is all.$k\n$Wsヒノカ|$Wa$E通常,|I'm in your debt for saving my life, but...\nYou're really...someone I don't understand.$k$pIt's useless to argue about\nthis matter anymore...$k$pBut, if you say that, then the\nreason you became my retainer$k$pwas to see how I would live?$k\n$Wsアサマ|$Wa$E笑,|Yes, that's right. Thanks to you,\nI've experienced many intense days.$k$pI'm truly glad I became\nyour retainer.$k\n$Wsヒノカ|$WaWell...\nI've said a lot of incredibly rude things.$k$pI was just distracted by talking to you.$k$pI apologize, Asama...$k\n$Wsアサマ|$WaNo, that's all right, it was a good\nway to kill time. Thank you very much.$k\n$Wsヒノカ|$WaKilling time, is it?$k$p$E笑,|*sigh*...\nThat's like you.$k
