I understand.$k$p$E笑,|I'll try to cooperate.$k\n$Wsカミラ|$Wa$E笑,|Oh my, that's good.$k$p...I say that, but I didn't think of what to talk\nabout.

MID_支援_カミラ_リョウマ_Ｂ: $a$t1$Wmカミラ|7$Wmリョウマ|3$w0|$Wsカミラ|$WaPrince Ryouma.$k\n$Wsリョウマ|$WaPrincess Camilla. The topic from the\nother day...what have you found?$k\n$Wsカミラ|$Wa$E苦,|About that...it seems that it really is hard to\nfind a topic for us to deepen our ties over.$k$pIn the first place, do we\neven have anything in common?$k\n$Wsリョウマ|$Wa$E怒,|That's true... Other than $Nu, how\nabout talking about our families?$k\n$Wsカミラ|$Wa$E通常,|I don't know anything else of interest...$k$p$E笑,|Ah! That's right.$k$pWould it not be more enjoyable to\nspeak with $Nu, just the three of us?$k\n$Wsリョウマ|$Wa$E通常,|I see.\nBut... would it not be a bother?$k\n$Wsカミラ|$Wa$Eキメ,|You're right. Still, I want to be able\nto watch over that child any time.$k$pI'll be worried if I can't protect them.$k\n$Wsリョウマ|$Wa$E苦,|You'd be preventing them\nfrom growing up, I think...$k\n$Wsカミラ|$Wa$E苦,|Eh?$k\n$Wsリョウマ|$Wa$E怒,|You should carve out your\nroad with your own power.$k$pIf you're too overprotective, they'll\nnever become strong that way.$k\n$Wsカミラ|$Wa$Eキメ,|It's fine.\nSince I'll always be protecting that child.$k\n$Wsリョウマ|$Wa$Eキメ,I said you shouldn't do so, for $Nu's sake.$k$pIt's important to\nlend a hand at times...$k$pBut not to the extent that\nthey get burnt from your care.$k\n$Wsカミラ|$Wa$E笑,|Haha... You're opposed to my\nopinion until the end, hmm?$k\n$Wsリョウマ|$Wa$E怒,|That's what I think is best for $Nu.$k\n$Wsカミラ|$Wa$E怒,|Alright. I'll do as you say.$k\n$Wsリョウマ|$Wa$E通常,|...?$k\n$Wsカミラ|$Wa$Eキメ,|You and me, we'll get an answer from\n$Nu to which of our thinking is right.$k\n$Wsリョウマ|$Wa$E苦,|Hey, to involve that person\nin this kind of conversation...$k\n$Wsカミラ|$Wa$E怒,|My, did you say that because\nyou had no confidence in winning?$k\n$Wsリョウマ|$Wa$E怒,|Mm!...Fine.
