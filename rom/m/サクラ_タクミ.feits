MID_支援_サクラ_タクミ_Ｃ: $t1$Wmサクラ|7$Wmタクミ|3$w0|$Wsサクラ|$WaU-um...$k\n$Wsタクミ|$WaHm?\nSakura, what's up?$k\n$Wsサクラ|$Wa$E怒,|Big Brother Takumi...\nCan I talk with you for a moment?$k$pAbout what was mentioned the other day...$k\n$Wsタクミ|$Wa$E苦,|Ah, it's "that", huh. I was also\nracking my brains about it.$k\n$Wsサクラ|$Wa$E苦,|Yes. A large banquet hosted\nby the Hoshidan royal family...$k$pI'm terrible in situations like that.$k\n$Wsタクミ|$WaMe too. But, I heard there'll be\nlots of famous lords present...$k$p$E怒,汗|So, it's not like we can't go...$k\n$Wsサクラ|$WaYes...$k\n$Wsタクミ|$Wa$E怒,|Is it even necessary to go to a banquet\nlike that in these war-ridden times?$k\n$Wsサクラ|$Wa$E怒,|Those meetings are practiced at varying\nintervals, since they're Hoshidan traditional $k$pevents... No matter what's happening,\nit doesn't seem like they'll stop...$k\n$Wsタクミ|$Wa$E苦,|Ahh... I understand.$k$pBut, I really don't feel comfortable\nwith formal settings like that...$k$pI don't really know what to say.$k\n$Wsサクラ|$Wa$E苦,|Yes. There are so many ways to\nbegin a conversation, I get confused...$k\n$Wsタクミ|$Wa$E怒,|Having said that, if you leave everyone\nto themselves, it's also irresponsible...$k\n$Wsサクラ|$Wa$E怒,|Yes.$k\n$Wsタクミ|$Wa$E通常,|Maybe we should think about\na way to successfully skip it...$k\n$Wsサクラ|$Wa$Eキメ,|Y-yes...! If I'm confused by myself,\nI never decide anything...$k\n$Wsタクミ|$Wa$E笑,|Yeah.\nLet's think about it together.$k
MID_支援_サクラ_タクミ_Ｂ: $t1$Wmサクラ|7$Wmタクミ|3$Wsタクミ|$Wa$Eキメ,|$w0|All right, let's think about ways\nto successfully skip a banquet.$k\n$Wsサクラ|$Wa$E怒,|Um...Big Brother Takumi.\nIs "skipping" okay?$k\n$Wsタクミ|$Wa$E怒,汗|Huh?$k\n$Wsサクラ|$Wa$Eキメ,|For example, isn't learning\n"a way to behave well" okay...?$k\n$Wsタクミ|$Wa$E苦,|Uhh...\nFor you, that's surprisingly bold.$k$pI was certainly thinking\nmore along the lines of...$k$p$E苦,汗|"Fake a stomach-ache,\ngo seclude yourself in the sick room",$k$por something...$k\n$Wsサクラ|$Wa$E苦,|I-I don't really want to do that, but...$k\n$Wsタクミ|$Wa$E怒,|Hmm, a way to behave well, is it.\nThat's... Can we do that?$k$p$E怒,汗|You get shy and tongue-tied, and I...\ntend to get unintentionally offensive.$k\n$Wsサクラ|$Wa$E怒,|Maybe we won't get any good\nideas with just the two of us.$k$pMaybe it would be preferable to...$k$p$Eキメ,|Discuss it with Aqua and the others.$k\n$Wsタクミ|$Wa$E苦,|Hmmm... But see, they'll be\nkind, but didn't you not want to$k$p$E苦,汗|trouble anyone in the first place?$k$p'Cause we started thinking about this\nso we wouldn't hold anyone back...$k\n$Wsサクラ|$Wa$E苦,|Th-that's right, isn't it...$k$pBut at this rate, we've got nothing, and\nthe banquet day is rapidly approaching...$k\n$Wsタクミ|$Wa$E怒,汗|Y-yeaahh, I'm stumped. I just don't feel\nlike I'm getting any ideas of what to do!$k\n$Wsサクラ|$Wa$E苦,汗|Y-yes, it's true...\nWhat should we do...$k
MID_支援_サクラ_タクミ_Ａ: $t1$Wmサクラ|7$Wmタクミ|3$Wsサクラ|$Wa$E笑,汗|$w0|Big Brother Takumi...$k\n$Wsタクミ|$Wa$E笑,汗|...Sakura. Ah-ahaha...\nHow should I say this?$k\n$Wsサクラ|$Wa$Eキメ,汗|It's "all's well that ends well", isn't it?$k\n$Wsタクミ|$Wa$E通常,汗|Indeed, perhaps... I never thought that\nalthough we didn't think of a plan, and$k$pthe banquet day arrived, and even with the\nfeelings of despair if we turned and started$k$pconversations recklessly, that everyone\nwould praise us to that extent...$k\n$Wsサクラ|$Wa$E笑,汗|Yes, I know...\nI talked to everyone.$k$p"I've known those two, and it seems that\ntheir feelings of doing their best were$k$pintroduced, and I'm quite\nhappy about that" was it...$k\n$Wsタクミ|$Wa$E怒,|Yeah, that's it. Doing nothing weird and\ntaking the important things like that into$k$pconsideration with great effort\nwas the most important, maybe.$k\n$Wsサクラ|$Wa$Eキメ,|Yes, that's it!$k\n$Wsタクミ|$Wa$E笑,|Sakura. From now on, as siblings lets\ngo hand in hand and do our best for the $k$psake of Hoshido.$k\n$Wsサクラ|$Wa$E笑,|Yes...Big Brother Takumi!$k
