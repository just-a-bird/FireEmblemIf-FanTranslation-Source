MID_支援_オロチ_リョウマ_Ｃ: $t1$Wmオロチ|7$w0|$Wsオロチ|$Wa... Fuu. Finally the last of those. It is\nfinally looking somewhat tidy.$k\n$Wmリョウマ|3$w0|$Wsリョウマ|$WaOrochi... What are you doing there?$k\n$Wsオロチ|$WaOh, Lord Ryouma. I'm organising my\ninventory of spell ingredients.$k\n$Wsリョウマ|$WaI see. Even spells need a lot of preparation.$k$p$E怒,|Hm? That card is...$k\n$Wsオロチ|$Wa$Eキメ,|Oh, this drawing. I drew it for one\nof Kagerou's spells.$k\n$Wsリョウマ|$WaOhhh... now that you mention it, he did\nmention that you are skilled at drawing.$k$p$E苦,|This is my first time seeing one of them...\nIt is very original...$k$pAtmospheric enough to feel the\nmagic flowing from it.$k\n$Wsオロチ|$Wa$E笑,|Hahaha! So you like it too Lord Ryouma!$k\n$Wsリョウマ|$Wa$E怒,汗|Yes, although I can't quite fully\nappreciate it.$k$pBut Kagerou and Orochi have been good\nfriends from a young age, haven't you?$k$p$E通常,|I must thank you for taking such good\ncare of my subordinate.$k\n$Wsオロチ|$Wa$E通常,汗|It's nothing, truly. To thank me for\nsomething so trifling...$k$pIt is very "you".$k\n$Wsリョウマ|$Wa...Very "me"?$k\n$Wsオロチ|$Wa$E通常,|I'm referring to your formal habits.$k$p$Eキメ,|I've been at the castle for a long time, but\nI have only ever heard you slip up.$k$pWhenever I speak to Kagerou, or\nLady Mikoto... I only hear of your nobility.$k\n$Wsリョウマ|$Wa$E怒,|Is that so...$k\n$Wsオロチ|$WaI want to hear some more interesting\nstories about you but...$k$p$E笑,|That might require some more patience.$k\n$Wsリョウマ|$Wa$E苦,|Haaa... I'm not an interesting man, am I...$k\n$Wsオロチ|$Wa$E苦,|I didn't mean it like that, Lord Ryouma!\nDon't make such a depressing face!$k$p$E怒,|Though... now that you mention it, you have\nbeen laughing less than you used to.$k\n$Wsリョウマ|$Wa$E怒,|You think so?$k\n$Wsオロチ|$WaYes. Ever since the war began you may\nnot have had the time for it...$k$pBut you haven't been smiling much either.$k$p$Eキメ,|...Alright then, I've decided.$k$pI'm going to make Lord Ryouma laugh\nlouder than he ever has before!$k\n$Wsリョウマ|$Wa$E怒,汗|L-louder than ever!?$k\n$Wsオロチ|$Wa$E通常,|Exactly. Seeing Lord Ryouma laugh loudly\nis a sight that is rarer than rare...$k$pIt'll be an interesting story of you to add to\nmy collection as well!$k$p$Eキメ,|Just wait a little bit, I will think of many\nnew ways to try and make you laugh!$k\n$Wsオロチ|$Wd$w0|$Wsリョウマ|$Wa$E怒,汗|Ah.. hey, Orochi!?$k$p$E苦,|...And there she goes.$k
MID_支援_オロチ_リョウマ_Ｂ: $t1$Wmリョウマ|3$w0|$Wsリョウマ|$Wa…………$k\n$Wmオロチ|7$w0|$Wsオロチ|$WaLord Ryouma, about what we talked\nabout the other day...$k\n$Wsリョウマ|$WaThe other day... you mean your plan\nto make me laugh?$k\n$Wsオロチ|$WaYes. I thought of many different\nmethods to try out...$k$pHow about we start with a story?$k$p$Eキメ,|Once you remember how to laugh properly,\nyou should be able to do it anytime!$k\n$Wsリョウマ|$Wa$E怒,汗|I... I suppose...$k$pI'm afraid I don't know many\nentertaining stories, though.$k\n$Wsオロチ|$WaThat's fine, I'll be telling you some\nof my best!$k\n$Wsリョウマ|$Wa$E通常,|Alright then, please do.$k\n$Wsオロチ|$Wa$E通常,|Let's see then... a-hem. How about we\nbegin with a story about Lady Mikoto?$k\n$Wsリョウマ|$Wa$E怒,|A story about mother?$k\n$Wsオロチ|$Wa$Eキメ,|Yes indeed. Lady Mikoto used to be\nsurprisingly silly.$k$pShe always dressed lightly in the snow, she\nwould eat sweets till her stomach ached...$k$p$E笑,|I couldn't get enough of watching her!$k\n$Wsリョウマ|$Wa$E苦,|M-mother was like that? It's amazing\nto think about...$k\n$Wsオロチ|$Wa$Eキメ,|Kagerou was no better. She went out into\nthe mountains to find dye for tarot cards...$k$p$E笑,|She got lost there, and ended up sending\na distress signal.$k$pShe even tried befriending a bear, thinking\nit was an ally in disguise!$k\n$Wsリョウマ|$Wa$E怒,汗|Kagerou really did that!?$k\n$Wsオロチ|$Wa$Eキメ,|Those two a treasure trove of fun stories.$k$p$E通常,|Well, you'd probably relate more to the\nstories about Kagerou.$k$pYou two have been together for so long\nafter all...$k\n$Wsリョウマ|$Wa$E笑,|Is that so... the stories were certainly\nrefreshing. I feel much more at ease.$k$pHearing stories of mother... hearing your\nfond memories of her make me happy.$k\n$Wsオロチ|$Wa$E笑,|Ohh, you just smiled there Lord Ryouma!$k\n$Wsリョウマ|$WaR-really... Well, that's good. But it's not as\ndramatic as the laugh you're seeking.$k$p$E苦,|I really must be an uninteresting person...$k\n$Wsオロチ|$Wa$E苦,|Don't be so dissapointed... Geez, how\nserious can you get...$k$p$E通常,|Just seeing you have fun like that is\nmore than enough for now.$k$p$E笑,|I'll never reach my goal unless you\nare happy too!$k\n$Wsリョウマ|$Wa$E笑,|Hmm... thank you Orochi.$k$pI should learn from your example, and\npay more attention to my friends.$k\n$Wsオロチ|$Wa$Eキメ,|Hehe, before that you should learn to pay\nmore attention to yourself, Lord Ryouma.$k

You have my\nthanks, Orochi.$k\n$Wsオロチ|$Wa$E笑,|Yes, yes, just like that!
