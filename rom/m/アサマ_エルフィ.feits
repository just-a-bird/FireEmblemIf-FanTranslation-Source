MID_支援_アサマ_エルフィ_Ｂ: $t1$Wmエルフィ|7$Wmアサマ|3$w0|$Wsアサマ|$Wa$E苦,|My, my, I heard a knight got injured while\nprotecting one of our allies and so...$k$pI came to have a look myself...who would've\nguessed that idiot turned out to be you.$k\n$Wsエルフィ|$Wa$E笑,|Oh Asama, are you here to heal me?\nPlease take care of me...$k\n$Wsアサマ|$Wa$E怒,|Being so calm after such injuries,\nis your body not important to you?$k\n$Wsエルフィ|$WaIf there's nothing to compare it\nwith, of course is important but...$k$pIn situations where my allies are in danger,\nthere is no point in caring for my body...$k\n$Wsアサマ|$WaI said this the other day,\nbut I genuinely don't understand.$k$pYou say "because they're allies" but that\ndisgusting belief of self-sacrifice...$k$pIt's as if you would say the same\nspiel towards your own enemies.$k\n$Wsエルフィ|$Wa$E怒,|You see... Depending on the situation,\nthere may be enemies that I protect.$k\n$Wsアサマ|$Wa$E苦,|Sigh...$k$pFor me to get this frustrated,\nmy amazement has wilted.$k$pWhat you just said...in some cases,\nthat can mean punishment you know?$k\n$Wsエルフィ|$Wa$E笑,|But...you won't tell\nanyone will you, Asama?$k\n$Wsアサマ|$Wa$E怒,|Well, who knows?$k\n$Wsエルフィ|$WaTo say such things...there's no way a healer\ncould be such a tattletale. I trust you...$k\n$Wsアサマ|$Wa$E苦,|My, my, I've been stabbed in the throat.$k$pWhether those words were truth\nor not...only god will know...$k$pEither way, all is grist\nthat comes to his mill.$k

People like you are\none of the world's biggest fools.$k$pDid you really protect a mere\nbandit, only to collapse......$k$pAnd then receiving injuries like this,\nwhat were you thinking?$k\n$Wsエルフィ|$Wa$Eキメ,|That enemy was...merely a child.\nHe was abandoned by the bandits.$k$pEven so, the archers sent down\na hail of arrows all at once...$k$pHe would've been killed in an instant. Killing\nsomeone in that way...it's just too much...$k\n$Wsアサマ|$Wa$E怒,|Even if you say that,\nending up like this is pointless!$k\n$Wsエルフィ|$Wa$E通常,|It's okay...\nI'm pretty sturdy.$k$pOn top of that, you came rushing\nin so quickly to heal me right?$k\n$Wsアサマ|$WaI wasn't rushing...$k\n$Wsエルフィ|$Wa$E笑,|Heehee...\nThank you Asama.$k\n$Wsアサマ|$Wa…………$k$p$E苦,|When I look at you, there's a\npart of me that gets frustrated.$k$pBut, I understand why that is now.$k\n$Wsエルフィ|$Wa$E通常,|...?$k\n$Wsアサマ|$WaProtecting everything with that\nself-sacrificing mindset of yours...$k$pIt's as if you're acting\nlike the gods themselves.$k\n$Wsエルフィ|$Wa$E苦,|Gods themselves...
