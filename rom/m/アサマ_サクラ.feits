You ended up crying because\nof me, and that started a weird rumor.$k$p$Eキメ,|Therefore in order to take responsibility,\nit is imperative that I marry you.$k$pBut of course, I am glad this\nfeeling is mutual, isn't that so?$k\n$Wsサクラ|$WaHehe... That's right.\nOnce more then.$k$pI accept this amulet as proof\nof your marriage proposal.$k\n$Wsアサマ|$WaThank you very much, Lady Sakura.\nPlease treat me well from now on.$k\n$Wsサクラ|$WaYes, same here.$k
