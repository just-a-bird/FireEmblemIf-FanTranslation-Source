MID_支援_オロチ_ニュクス_Ｃ: $t1$Wmオロチ|3$w0|$Wsオロチ|$WaNYX! \nYou're here, aren't you, Nyx!$k\n$Wmニュクス|7$Wsニュクス|$Wa$w0|You don't have to be so loud. I can hear \nyou. Can't you be a little bit more quiet?$k\n$Wsオロチ|$WaOh? So, you were here?\nActually, I have to talk with you.$k\n$Wsニュクス|$Wa$Eキメ,|I see....But, I really don't want to get too \ninvolved with folks from Hoshido.$k$pBut if it's something that has to be said, \nthen I'll give you a moment.\n$k\n$Wsオロチ|$Wa$E怒,|Well then, I'll get right to the point.\nWon't you face me in a duel?$k\n$Wsニュクス|$Wa$E苦,|Huh...?$k\n$Wsオロチ|$Wa$Eキメ,|You and I go at it by using our incantations.\nYou look down on me as a master of them....$k$pI want to ask you to become better friends \nwith me.$k\n$Wsニュクス|$Wa$Eキメ,|I see...\nBut, that has nothing to do with me.$k$pRather, I'm not interested.$k\n$Wsオロチ|$Wa$E苦,|What..!?$k\n$Wsニュクス|$Wa$E通常,|For starters, you say we use the same \nincantations. But, the details between $k$pHoshido and Nohr are different. And yet, \nyou don't think about taking note of at least $k$pthat much?$k\n$Wsオロチ|$Wa$E怒,|MMM....That's not it.\nI have taken note of that.$k\n$Wsニュクス|$Wa$E怒,|So, why...$k\n$Wsオロチ|$WaEven though the content and nature are \ndifferent, you and I are fellow practitioners. $k$p And if we're talking about appearances,\nthen I'm older than you....$k$p$E苦,|But if it's how we talk and look,\nthen you are the adult. $k$p If someone were to ask for an incantation, \nthen our comrades will find you to be the $k$preliable one.$k\n$Wsニュクス|$WaAhh...I see.\nSo, that's why you are in a bad mood.$k$p$Eキメ,|Well, it is true that I am an adult on the \ninside and I don't think that's a mistake.$k\n$Wsオロチ|$Wa$E怒,|What....!? In that case, we must have \na match! I'll prove to you my superiority $k$pas a master! Prepare yourself!$k\n$Wsオロチ|$Wd$w0|$Wsニュクス|$Wa$E苦,|Haa...This is becoming quite a pain.$k
MID_支援_オロチ_ニュクス_Ｂ: $t1$Wmオロチ|3$Wmニュクス|7$Wsオロチ|$Wa$E怒,|$w0|Now then, Nyx...$k$pWon't you have a match of dignity\nbetween masters of incantations with me?$k$pHow should we have our match? Medicine \ncreation? Or maybe charms and spells?$k\n$Wsニュクス|$Wa$Eキメ,|You're at fault for going off and getting \nexcited...$k$pI said it before.\nI am not interested.$k$pSo, I won't have a match with you.$k\n$Wsオロチ|$Wa$Eキメ,|Hmph. That means you're scared?$k\n$Wsニュクス|$Wa$E怒,|I won't be caught up with such a simple \nprovocation... You really are just a pain.$k$pBesides, I accept you as a master\nwithout the need of a match.$k\n$Wsオロチ|$Wa$E怒,|Hmm...? What do you mean by that?$k\n$Wsニュクス|$WaYour stance in regards to your spells\ndeserves enough of my respect when I look $k$pat it.$k$p$Eキメ,|You're young and you persistently face off \nagainst such magics. I am envious of that...$k\n$Wsオロチ|$Wa$E苦,|Young? No matter how you look at it,\nyou're younger than me...$k$pSorry Nyx, But I don't see what you're\ntalking about.What do you mean by that?$k\n$Wsニュクス|$Wa…………$k$p$E通常,|You're right. As fellow practitioners,\nI can talk to you about it.$k$pWhen I was younger, my talents for \nincantations surpassed all...$k$pBack then, \nI overestimated that power of mine.$k$p$E怒,|I used too much of such magics in sport.\nTo compensate for such a strong curse, $k$pmy body stopped growing...$k\n$Wsオロチ|$Wa$E怒,汗|…！！$k\n$Wsニュクス|$Wa$Eキメ,|That's why I'm older than I look...$k$p$E笑,|Fufu... You talked a lot about how I look \nlike an adult.$k\n$Wsオロチ|$Wa$E怒,|Hmm... \nSo, you had such a past.$k\n$Wsニュクス|$Wa$E通常,|Yes. And that's why I think you understand \nour differences as masters.$k\n$Wsオロチ|$Wa$E怒,汗|But as someone of the same trade, \nthat could have been me as well. $k$pI sympathize for you. $k$p$E怒,|For example, isn't it good not to be so \ngloomy about yourself?$k\n$Wsニュクス|$Wa$E怒,|Why?$k\n$Wsオロチ|$WaLong ago, you played around with your \npower. $k$pBut ever since then, your power is of use \nto others.$k$pIn that case, there's quite the number of\nfolk who you've helped.$k$p$Eキメ,|Nyx... I think you need to have \nmore confidence in yourself.$k\n$Wsニュクス|$Wa$E笑,|Those words sounds like something you \nwould say.$k\n$Wsオロチ|$Wa$E笑,|Fufu..You weren't praising me there?$k\n$Wsニュクス|$Wa$E通常,照|I wasn't really...\nI just said what I thought.$k\n$Wsオロチ|$Wa$Eキメ,|Oh? But don't tell me you're blushing?\nWhat's this? You also have your $k$pcute moments?$k\n$Wsニュクス|$Wa$E怒,照|Don't tease your elders.$k$p$E笑,|But thank you, Orochi. Your words have \nmade me feel a little better.$k
MID_支援_オロチ_ニュクス_Ａ: $t1$Wmオロチ|3$Wmニュクス|7$w0|$Wsオロチ|$WaNyx, do you have a minute?$k\n$Wsニュクス|$WaOh? Orochi?$k$pWhat is it? \nYou want to have your match with me?$k\n$Wsオロチ|$WaNo, I'm done with what happened a few days \nago.$k$pRather, as fellow masters, I think we \nneed to be even better friends.$k$p$Eキメ,|I want to learn Nohr magic and talk with \nyou a whole lot from now on.$k\n$Wsニュクス|$Wa$E笑,|I see... You talk about having a match, and \nnow you're talking about becoming better $k$pfriends. You're all talk.$k\n$Wsオロチ|$Wa$E笑,|Fufu...I want to flexible and talk with you.$k\n$Wsニュクス|$WaFufu...But, you're right. I guess it's fine \nif I talk with you.$k$p$Eキメ,|Looking at you, I feel like my sadness is \nrather small.$k\n$Wsオロチ|$Wa$E怒,|What do you mean?$k\n$Wsニュクス|$Wa$E通常,|I avoided interacting with folk from Hoshido\nso I can atone for myself.$k$p$E笑,|But, I'm going to accept those thoughts.\nYour words of encouragement have made me $k$phappy, Orochi.$k\n$Wsオロチ|$Wa$E苦,|Nyx..$k\n$Wsニュクス|$Wa$E通常,|If I met you when I was younger...$k$pthen I probably would have walked down\na better path in life as well. $k$p$E怒,|If it's you, then I think I would definitely \nscold the proud me.$k\n$Wsオロチ|$Wa$E怒,|I see...$k$pYour past isn't going to change,\nBut I'll be with you in the future.$k$p$E笑,|From now on, be at peace and rely on me.$k\n$Wsニュクス|$Wa$E笑,|Fufu...I understand.$k$pThe difference between your appearance and\nwho you are inside mutually $k$presemble each other.$k\n$Wsオロチ|$Wa$E怒,汗|So, you probably want to say that I'm a kid \ninside!?$k\n$Wsニュクス|$WaOh? I don't know about that.$k\n$Wsオロチ|$Wa$E怒,|What was that?!\nNyx...I take back what I said earlier!$k$pI won't be at peace until I get my match with \nyou!!$k\n$Wsニュクス|$WaFufu...If you say that, then I'll face you \nfor a little while...$k
