You've always\nbeen a bit different from me.$k$p$E通常,|Sister... you're quite different from me.$k$pYou're always calm while doing\nyour work, by all means skillfully.$k$pIn my case, I'm clumsy and get strictly\nscolded... occasionally, comforted gently...$k$p$E笑,|I'm saying this clearly now-a sister like\nyou is my very ideal... My aspiration...$k\n$Wsフローラ|$Wa$E通常,|Felicia...$k\n$Wsフェリシア|$Wa$E苦,汗|But, there's something I can't comprehend.$k$p$E怒,|As I've said many times, sometimes\nyou are angry but keep it to yourself.$k$pSo... at what moment\ndid you... become angry?$k$p$Eキメ,|Vaguely, I understood that...\nIt was after I took the weapons.$k\n$Wsフローラ|$Wa$E怒,|After you took them?$k\n$Wsフェリシア|$WaYes.$k$pBack in the Ice Tribe Village,\nyou were like that all the time.$k$p$E怒,|After weapons training, you... wouldn't\ncome and talk to me every once in a while.$k$p$E苦,汗|And, it's the same now. After the mission,\nyou... were somewhat... scary.$k\n$Wsフローラ|$Wa$Eキメ,|…………$k$p...I see. So, that was the reason.$k$p$E怒,|Hey, Felicia. Let's talk a little, please?$k$pAbout me... why it looks like\nthat and what I think about it.$k\n$Wsフェリシア|$Wa$E怒,|...Yes.$k
MID_支援_フェリシア_フローラ_Ａ: $t1$Wmフェリシア|7$Wmフローラ|3$Wsフローラ|$Wa$E笑,|$w0|Felicia. I got it at last.\nThe reason why I looked angry to you...$k\n$Wsフェリシア|$Wa$E焦り,汗|Really?!$k\n$Wsフローラ|$Wa$E怒,|First off, I wasn't angry.\nI can say this much, clearly.$k\n$Wsフェリシア|$Wa$E苦,汗|Th-then why...$k\n$Wsフローラ|$Wa$E怒,|Usually, you are pretty clumsy.$k$pSo, it was then that I thought of\nprotecting you as your older sister.$k$pBut after you took up arms...\nYou became a very reliable soldier.$k$p$Eキメ,汗|But, I... I wasn't as excellent\na soldier as you were.$k\n$Wsフェリシア|$Wa$E怒,汗|No, no way...$k\n$Wsフローラ|$Wa$E怒,|I'll say this simply...\nI was envious of that, Felicia.$k\n$Wsフェリシア|$Wa$E焦り,汗|Eh?$k\n$Wsフローラ|$Wa$E苦,汗|With that sudden change\nof positions on the battlefield...$k$pThe one who protects and the\none who is protected...$k$pI felt like I was no longer the older sister...\nI couldn't grasp that new dynamic.$k$pMaybe that's why I had been\navoiding you after the mission.$k\n$Wsフェリシア|$WaNo way. That's why I\nmistook you... for being angry?$k\n$Wsフローラ|$Wa$E怒,|I think so. When we were in Freesia,\nit was like that too...$k$pWhen the training started, our Father,\nthe head of the village, praised only you.$k$p$Eキメ,|So, I disliked training.$k\n$Wsフェリシア|$Wa$E苦,汗|No... I didn't understand that at all...\nI'm sorry about the misunderstanding...$k\n$Wsフローラ|$Wa$E笑,|It's alright. I should thank you instead.$k$p$E怒,|Because you were often\ntelling me I was angry,$k$pI was able to recognize something...$k$p$E苦,汗|Because of my jealousy...$k$pI ended up closing off my own\nheart with such negativity feelings.$k$p$E通常,|Unknowingly, I wounded Felicia,\nmy family... I am sorry...$k$pFrom this point onwards, I'll be honest too.$k$pMy feelings for Felicia have\nchanged from envy to admiration.$k\n$Wsフェリシア|$Wa$E焦り,汗|No, no way... My sister... is admiring me...!\nBut, I also... I admire for you too...!$k\n$Wsフローラ|$Wa$E笑,|Heehee. Isn't that great? We're twins...\nTogether, we embrace similar thoughts...$k$pIt's no wonder. Take care\nof me from now on, Felicia.$k\n$Wsフェリシア|$Wa$E笑,|Y-yes! That's what I should say!\nPlease, from now until forever...$k$pAlways, always take care of\nyour clumsy younger sister!$k
