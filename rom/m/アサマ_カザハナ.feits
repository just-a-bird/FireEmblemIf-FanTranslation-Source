MID_支援_アサマ_カザハナ_Ｃ: $t1$Wmカザハナ|7$w0|$Wsカザハナ|$WaThis area seems good...$k$pA great place to get away to,\nin the middle of the mountains$k$pwhere no one can enter\nand meet with me.$k$pRight, this tree will do fine.\nI'll let out my fighting spirit...!!$k$p$E怒,|Hah!!\nUrahhh!!!!!$k\n$Wmアサマ|3$VF隠|$w0|$Wsアサマ|$WaUwah?!$k\n$Wsカザハナ|$WaHuh? Right now, a shriek came as the\ntree collapsed... That voice just now...$k\n$Wsアサマ|$Wa$E苦,|$VF出|Good grief...what was that?\nI was taking a hike through the$k$pmountains, why did a tree\nsuddenly collapse...?$k$pOwowow...$k\n$Wsカザハナ|$Wa$E苦,|Asama?!\nPerhaps you collided with it?$k$pI-I'm so sorry!\nIt was me who cut that tree...!!$k\n$Wsアサマ|$Wa$E怒,|Kazahana...?! Why are you\nthis deep in the mountain?$k$pFurthermore, what's with\nthe tree-cutting...?$k$pAre you trying to be a woodcutter?$k\n$Wsカザハナ|$Wa$E怒,|No, I'm not trying to be\nsomething like that...$k$p...Hold on!$k$pThat isn't important right now,\nshow me your wound! I must treat it!$k\n$Wsアサマ|$Wa$E苦,|H-haa...$k\n$Wsカザハナ|$Wa$E通常,|Ah, it's just a light bruise.\nThat's a relief...$k\n$Wsアサマ|$Wa$E通常,|Right. I don't feel pain that much,\nso treatments are unneeded.$k$pNow, back to you. Why were you\ncutting down trees incidentally?$k\n$Wsカザハナ|$Wa$E苦,|That was...for the\ngood of my training.$k$p...Who has the time to do a bout with me,\neither using a wooden or practice sword?$k$pBut, that left me very unsatisfied...$k$pSometimes, I go deep\ninto the mountains,$k$pwhere I do my training\nalone with a real sword.$k\n$Wsアサマ|$WaI see... That sword must\nrepresent the samurai's soul.$k\n$Wsカザハナ|$Wa$E笑,|Heehee, that's not much\nof an exaggeration.$k$pThe time when I had possessed a\nsword is when a feeling flashed within me.$k$pOther weapons are different,\ncompared to a samurai and their katana...$k$pAs other people are as well.$k\n$Wsアサマ|$WaSo, that's it.$k$pHow you used your katana to strike\nthe tree at the trunk to make it fall,$k$pyou befit that of a monster.$k$p$E苦,|An unexpected blessing I'd say,\nas this is a place where lives drop.$k\n$Wsカザハナ|$Wa$E苦,|I-I told you before\nthat I was sorry!$k
MID_支援_アサマ_カザハナ_Ｂ: $t1$Wmカザハナ|7$w0|$Wsカザハナ|$Wa$E怒,|Alright! Today, it's\ntraining with my sword!$k$pUmm... Asama shouldn't be nearby.$k$pBack then, I was met by those sharp\neyes, so I'll check if it's good this time.$k$p...Alrighty, nobody's around.$k$p$Eキメ,|Well then, today this tree has grown\nsome small branches in succession$k$pfor me to chop up...!$k$pEyayayayayah!\nEyahhh!$k\n$Wmアサマ|3$VF隠|$w0|$Wsアサマ|$WaTh-that hurt! That really hurt!!\nOwowowow!$k\n$Wsカザハナ|$Wa$E苦,|Huhhhhhhh?!$k\n$Wsアサマ|$WaThere were some twigs flying off,\nhitting me in rapid succession!!$k\n$Wsカザハナ|$WaC-could you be here,\nby any chance, Asama?$k\n$Wsアサマ|$Wa$VF出|$E苦,|U-ugh... What's with attacking in waves...?!\nOne by one, they shouldn't make a big fuss.$k$pI shouldn't have to be collecting\nsome damage from random fire...$k$pHuh, Kazahana? Somehow,\nwere you behind that twig attack?$k\n$Wsカザハナ|$WaU-ugh... S-sorry.$k\n$Wsアサマ|$Wa$E怒,|Again with that...?$k$pWhat kind of person are you,\none that advances their practice$k$pby doing what you did before?$k\n$Wsカザハナ|$Wa$E怒,|N-no way! This time, I checked if anyone\nwas near the area! It was inevitable!$k\n$Wsアサマ|$Wa$E苦,|I thank you for lacking credibility...\nAfter all, this is the second time$k$pI've had the misfortune of\nbearing witness to your training...$k\n$Wsカザハナ|$Wa$E怒,汗|S-such groundless charges...!$k$pFirst of all, you probably don't even\nhave a reason for harassing me?$k\n$Wsアサマ|$WaBut, to be quite honest, I don't\ncare if others think well of me.$k$pIt's difficult to believe what they say...$k\n$Wsカザハナ|$Wa$E苦,|Wh-what I say, huh...?\nThen...in that case, what should I do?$k\n$Wsアサマ|$Wa$E通常,|Right...$k$pI suppose for the sake of your training\n if you'd like to enter the mountain at$k$psome time, please invite me.$k\n$Wsカザハナ|$Wa$E怒,|Huh?$k\n$Wsアサマ|$Wa$Eキメ,|I would be able to understand where you\nwill be, so it would be good if I do not$k$papproach there. So, in short, you'll have\nyour own place to go for your training,$k$pand we can journey around\ntogether is what I'm saying.$k\n$Wsカザハナ|$Wa$E通常,|I get it... Yep, understood.$k$pNext time, I'll give you a call.$k\n$Wsアサマ|$Wa$E通常,|Sure, please do so.$k
MID_支援_アサマ_カザハナ_Ａ: $t1$Wmカザハナ|7$w0|$Wsカザハナ|$Wa$E怒,|Well now, today for the sake of my\nsword practice, I'll cut this tree down!$k\n$Wmアサマ|3$w0|$Wsアサマ|$Wa$E怒,|Don't do it, Kazahana!!$k\n$Wsカザハナ|$Wa$E通常,|Ah. Asama... What's up?$k\n$Wsアサマ|$Wa$E苦,|"What's up", is not it!$k$pWhy did you arrive ahead of me,\nwhen you didn't even call?$k$pThe time when you go and train is\nwhen we go together, or was that$k$pnot our agreement?$k\n$Wsカザハナ|$Wa$E通常,汗|Ahh... I must've forgotten.\nSorry～! Heehee!$k\n$Wsアサマ|$Wa$E怒,|Don't you "heehee" me!$k$pDespite our agreement, you've already\nwent out for training alone for a third time?$k\n$Wsカザハナ|$Wa$E苦,|Gah. S-so what if I did?!$k\n$Wsアサマ|$Wa$E怒,汗|The first time, you sliced the tree from its\nbase, so that when it collided with the earth$k$pI could feel the vibrations through my feet.\nI was close to nearly falling in the mud.$k$pThe second time, you let out a yell of\nsurprise, so I was attacked by a flock$k$pof escaping bats. The third time,\nyou had rushed on ahead with your$k$pkatana, already drawing it from its sheath...\nThe pit of my stomach jumped.$k$pYes, that's it.\nThis is the thing you lost!!$k\n$Wsカザハナ|$Wa$E通常,汗|A-ahaha... Thanks... After that I tried\nlooking for it, but couldn't find it...$k\n$Wsアサマ|$Wa$E怒,|That's good, then!$k\n$Wsカザハナ|$Wa$E苦,|But, what do you mean third time?\nDid I not call out for you...?$k\n$Wsアサマ|$Wa$E苦,|Seems that three times wasn't enough\nto get the impact of my words across.$k$pReally...what the heck is this...?\nPerhaps this is some sort of punishment...?$k\n$Wsカザハナ|$Wa$E通常,|Hm, maybe so.$k\n$Wsアサマ|$Wa$E怒,|"Maybe so", my foot...\nAt any rate, today we shall travel together.$k\n$Wsカザハナ|$WaYep, gotcha.$k\n$Wc$Sbv40|1000|$Fo1000|$Sbv100|1000|$Fi1000|$Wsアサマ|$Wa$E苦,|As expected... Going along with you to not\nmeet with any injury was part of my reading.$k$pToday, with no signs of injuries...\nIt's a miracle.$k\n$Wsカザハナ|$Wa$E笑,|Ahahaha, is that so?\nStranger things could've happened.$k$pSurely, up until now, you've spewed out\nabusive language to various people as$k$pa form of punishment. And just like me,\nyou came to the rescue as my savior$k$pbecause of it.$k\n$Wsアサマ|$Wa$E怒,|I'm about done with\nall of your deeds...$k$pHowever...I don't find this\nto be like any other revelation.$k$pFor the time being, as I perform\nmy practices on the mountain,$k$pyou should accompany me.$k\n$Wsカザハナ|$WaSure, I got it.$k

Are you possibly\ngoing to train with your sword again?$k$pIn that case, I'd have to tag along.$k$pI was just wondering exactly\nwhen I'd climb the mountain.$k\n$Wsカザハナ|$WaUmm... It's a little different.$k\n$Wsアサマ|$WaWhat is it? Do you believe that it is\nannoying when I accompany you?$k$pHaven't I said before why we\ngo together? It is for my sake...!$k\n$Wsカザハナ|$Wa$Eキメ,照|Th-that's not it!$k$pI'm saying that...you and I should\nbe together forever from now on...$k\n$Wsアサマ|$Wa$E苦,|So? It's only natural to\nrequest this sort of...$k$p$E苦,照|...Huh?$k$pF-forever...?!$k\n$Wsカザハナ|$WaY-yeah... Not only when we go to\nthe mountain to do our practices,$k$pI mean, together forever\nis what I mean...$k\n$Wsアサマ|$Wa$E怒,照|Is that a confession of love...?\nBut, why me...?$k\n$Wsカザハナ|$Wa$E怒,照|In the many times I was able\nto practice in the mountains...$k$pI had felt anxiously lonely\non various occasions...$k$pThe times when you were nearby,\nit was fun and reassuring.$k$pThat's why I thought about you\nand I being together, forever...$k\n$Wsアサマ|$WaSo, that was it...\nThat surprised me a little...$k$p$Eキメ,照|...There is no reason\nfor me to refuse.$k\n$Wsカザハナ|$Wa$Eキメ,照|Huh...?!$k\n$Wsアサマ|$WaPerhaps until now...$k$pIt was no accident that we'd encountered\none another in the middle of the mountains.$k$pI suppose this is some sort of revelation...\nthat I would always be beside you...$k$pIt was fate that you would\nbe my companion.$k$p...Or, so the gods would say.$k\n$Wsカザハナ|$Wa$E笑,照|Th-then...?!$k\n$Wsアサマ|$Wa$E笑,照|Correct.
